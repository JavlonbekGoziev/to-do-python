## Project Report

### Project Title: To-Do List Application

---

### 1. Introduction

#### 1.1 Brief Overview  
The To-Do List Application is a user-friendly platform designed to help users efficiently manage their tasks. Users can add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed. Additionally, they can download the list of tasks as a text file.

#### 1.2 Problem Solved  
Many people struggle with organizing their tasks. This application offers a simple and effective way to create, manage, and track tasks, making it easier for users to stay organized and meet deadlines.

#### 1.3 Target Audience  
Students, professionals, and anyone who needs help with task management.

### 2. Requirements

#### 2.1 Functional Requirements  
- Add, edit, delete tasks.  
- Mark tasks as completed.  
- Display tasks with details, content, and reminders.  
- Download tasks in `.txt` format.

#### 2.2 Non-Functional Requirements  
- The system should be user-friendly and responsive.  
- The system should save data across sessions via a JSON file.  
- The GUI should be intuitive and simple.

---

### 3. Technologies Used  
- **Python**: Core logic of the application.  
- **Tkinter**: GUI development.  
- **JSON**: Storing task data.  
- **OS Module**: File management.

---

### 4. System Architecture

#### 4.1 Overview of Architecture  
- **Front-End**: Tkinter-based GUI where users can view tasks and interact with them (add, edit, delete, mark as completed).
- **Back-End**: Python-based business logic that processes user actions and handles task data using a JSON file.
- **Data Storage**: Task data is stored in a JSON file, ensuring data persistence across application sessions.

### 5. Implementation

#### 5.1 Overview  
The To-Do List Application is built using Python and Tkinter. Tasks are stored in a JSON file for data persistence between application sessions. The app allows users to add, edit, delete, mark tasks as completed, and export tasks to a `.txt` file.

#### 5.2 Key Features  
- **Task Management**: Add, edit, delete tasks.  
- **Mark as Completed**: Tasks can be marked as completed, visually updated.  
- **Data Persistence**: Tasks are stored in a JSON file and loaded on app startup.  
- **Task Export**: Tasks can be exported as a `.txt` file containing task details, reminders, and completion status.

### 7. Challenges and Solutions

#### 7.1 Problem 1: Task Persistence Across Sessions  
**Solution**: Used a JSON file to store tasks and load it on application start to ensure data persistence.

#### 7.2 Problem 2: User-Friendly GUI  
**Solution**: Used Tkinter's layout management (frames, labels, buttons) to create a simple, organized, and intuitive interface.

#### 7.3 Problem 3: File Operations (Exporting Tasks)  
**Solution**: Used Python's file handling to write task data to a `.txt` file when exporting.

### 8. Conclusion  
The To-Do List Application successfully meets the needs of task management. Its user-friendly interface and powerful features make it an effective tool for anyone looking to stay organized.

---

### 9. Future Improvements  
- User authentication for saving tasks specific to individual users.  
- Reminders and notifications for tasks.  
- Cloud synchronization for storing tasks across devices.

---

### 10. Impact  
This application helps users manage their tasks efficiently, reducing the risk of missed deadlines and forgotten tasks.
